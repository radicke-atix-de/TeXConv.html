\section {Tex-Imput}

Example:

\begin{verbatim}
\input{./testfiles/input_test_file.tex}
\end{verbatim} 

The \\input command causes the indicated file to be read and processed,
exactly as if its contents had\footnote{Anmerkung in input-Datei} been 
inserted in the current file at that
point. The file name may be a complete file name with extension or just a
first name, in which case the file FILE.TEX is used.
